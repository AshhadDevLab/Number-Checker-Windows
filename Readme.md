## Instructions

### Warning

- **Do not delete or modify the `data` or `assets` folders.** These folders contain crucial information for the application. Making changes or removing them can cause unexpected behavior.

### Pre-requisites

- Ensure that both **WhatsApp** and **Telegram Application** Desktop Applications are preinstalled on your system before starting the application.

### Troubleshooting

- If the application has been started and WhatsApp or Telegram cannot be opened, use the **App Detector** tool to identify whether the applications are on the system. If they are present, their paths will be updated automatically.
- The results of this automated process are saved inside the respective `WhatsApp` or `Telegram` folder within the `data` folder.

### Important Notes

- The `reference.png` images are used to detect if there are no results. Modifying these images can cause unexpected results. Change them at your own risk.
- Screenshots are saved inside the `WhatsApp` and `Telegram` folders within the `assets` folder.
